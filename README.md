## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrey, I'm usually working on my own projects here, on GitHub. There are a lot of utilities for solving different tasks that appear in my Internet life and something done for fun.

Something that made just for fun:

  * [andre.life](https://github.com/andre487/andre.life) â€“ my homepage with its own simple building system
  * [Game of Life](https://github.com/andre487/game-of-life) â€“ an implementation of Conway's Game of Life on TS + Parcel; you can try it on [life.underlime.net](https://life.underlime.net)
  * [asm-primes](https://github.com/andre487/asm-primes) â€“ a programm on NASM that calculates a sum of primes; was written only for assembler fun

Different JS/TS things:

  * [node-console-progress-bar-tqdm](https://github.com/andre487/node-console-progress-bar-tqdm) â€“ progress bar for CLI on Node.js (TS) with an interface that very similar to Python's TQDM
  * [node-linkify-lite](https://github.com/andre487/node-linkify-lite) â€“ very lightweight library for replacing URLs in a text with HTML links; doesn't support TS for now, but if someone asks, I'll do it

Different utility things:

  * [dotfiles](https://github.com/andre487/dotfiles) â€“ config files for *nix systems: zsh, tmux, vim, git and others, some useful scripts
  * [sms487](https://github.com/andre487/sms487) â€“ an Android app (on Java) and a server (on Python + MongoDB) for sending notifications from a phone to other devices
  * [publish-to-orphan-gh-pages](https://github.com/andre487/publish-to-orphan-gh-pages) - a GitHub action (on JS) that I use for publishing my GitHub pages
  * [infrastructure](https://github.com/andre487/infrastructure) â€“ some Ansible playbooks ans shell scripts for deploying server solutions
  * [dumbproxy-log-monitor](https://github.com/andre487/dumbproxy-log-monitor) â€“ I use proxy servers based on [dumbproxy](https://github.com/SenseUnit/dumbproxy) and this utility (on Go + SQLite) for monitoring activity in their logs
  * [huegrok](https://github.com/andre487/huegrok) â€“ since Ngrok isn't available anymore in my location, I created my own solution with Bash and Ansible; simple but good enough for my tasks
  * [github-repos-backuper](https://github.com/andre487/github-repos-backuper) â€“ nobody knows the future of GitHub there, so I have this utility for periodically backing up of my repositories; it clones all of them to a local storage
  * [busybox-utils](https://github.com/andre487/busybox-utils) â€“ utils based on Busybox for environments where are no package managers and a lack of useful utils
